## Well how should I start this?  Ever since I got my first phone I've always been curious to see how apps are created. I love to play games and see all the different things you can download on your phone and computer. Having no technical background it seemed impossible to create such things. I used to watch videos on youtube about programming and they all looked like hieroglyphs. 
## The fact of the matter is that I had a desire to learn about coding but I did not have a clear direction nor guidance on how to start programming. I put this off for a few years although it was always in the back of my mind. I was recommended to enroll in Flatiron School by someone really close to me. She had stated that a few coworkers including her manager went to Flatiron. The fact that their college background doesn't relate to their professions was shocking to me. So, seeing this as an opportunity, I decided to do my research and enroll in this course.
## At the beginning of the apply process, I had no idea what I was assigning myself for, but once I started getting to know people who are in the same program and experience coders, the fog cleared up and the questions in  my head about where I am heading got resolved . 
## I am now much more confident in what I am aiming to accomplish throughout this course and with programming, I have grown very excited to see what I can do with the skills and practice them to solve real-life problems.  
## All in all, I decided to become a software engineer first due to my curiosity, other's experiences,  and the lack of knowledge I have on this topic. Now, I'm not driven to pursue this as my career because of a desire to create something that will contribute to everyone's lives and facilitate the economy's growth using technology. 
# I am pushing myself to greater heights everyday to succeed and obtain better career opportunities.
